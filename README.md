This is the repository for the study 'Ensemble perception in the time domain: evidence in favor of logarithmic encoding of time intervals'., Yue Ren, Fredrik Allenmark, Hermann J. MÃ¼ller, Zhuanghua Shi.

1. Please download all the files from this repository in one local folder, and designate the same folder as the current working directory.

2. Running the file 'Main_Figure.R' independently returns: 1), the main analyses and plots (Figures 4 to 6) in the manuscript, and 2), data source including raw data, basic statistics.

(tips: Please collapse all the chunks (separate with ----##) for a clearer structure.)

3. The whole procedure of the model fitting can be found in 'model_simulation.R', which can also be run independently.
